# Papillary-Thyroid-Carcinoma-Gene-Panel
========================================
Abstract
----------------------------------------
In this study, differentially expressed transcriptomes of three subtypes of papillary thyroid carcinoma (Classical, Follicular and TallCell) were obtained from TCGA database, and the specific genes expressed in each subtypes were analyzed for immune correlation. The survival-related gene Panel in the Classical subtype was calculated by machine learning , and the targeted gene related to lymph node involvement among the three subtypes and the drug related to them were screened in the end.

This study can provide a theoretical basis for targeted drug research in thyroid papillary carcinoma.

Analysis plan
-----------------------------------------
1.TCGA thyroid cancer related data acquisition

2.Screening for differentially expressed genes in each subtype

3.Analyzing the differentially expressed genes of each subtype distinguished from other subtypes

4.DEG GO and KEGG analysis

5.Correlation analysis between specific genes of each subtype and typical mutant genes

6.Analysis of specific genes and immune correlations of each subtype

7.Screening survival-related gene panels in the Classical subtype

8.Screening of gene panels associated with lymph node involvement in each subtype

9.Targeted drug screening of Gene Panel
